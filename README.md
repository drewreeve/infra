# Infra

Ansible playbook for (crudely) configuring machines in my homelab.

### Requirements

* Needs passlib for adguard role
* Run `just reqs` to install additional roles/collections

### Usage

After cloning run `scripts/git-init.sh` or `just init` to configure a pre-commit
hook to hopefully avoid committing secrets!
